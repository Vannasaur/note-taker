## Usage

In order to use this application you must first navigate to the webpage. Click the blue Get Started button. 

You will be directed to the notes page which will hold your previously saved notes on the left-hand side. On the right-hand side of the page, you will see an empty note with placeholder text of Note Title and Note Text. 

You can type in the title of your note and the text related to your note into those fields. Once you've completed your note, click on the save button on the top right. Once saved, the note will be moved to the left sidebar. 

If you would like to look into your previous notes, just click on the note and it will be displayed on the right hand side so you can look at the note title and text. If you would like to start a new note, you may click on the plus button on the top right. 

All previously saved notes will be saved until manually deleted. To delete a note, click on the red trashcan button located next to the saved note.
